## 🎯 Problem Statement

Walmart processes millions of transactions daily, making it a prime target for fraudulent activities. Current fraud detection systems often rely on post-transaction analysis, leading to:
- **$32 billion** annual loss due to payment fraud in retail
- **48 hours** average detection time for sophisticated fraud
- **23%** false positive rate causing legitimate customer frustration
- **Limited real-time protection** during peak shopping periods

## 💡 Our Solution: SecureCart AI

An advanced AI-powered real-time fraud detection system that combines:
- **Machine Learning** for pattern recognition
- **Blockchain** for transaction integrity
- **Biometric Authentication** for identity verification
- **Zero-Trust Architecture** for comprehensive security
